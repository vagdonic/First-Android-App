# First-Android-App
This is my First Android App using JAVA.

There are 3 buttons namely: Toast, Count, Random.
<br>
Toast is a simple button to display a message.
<br>
On pressing the Count button, the number on the screen increasing by 1 starting with 0.
<br>
On pressing the Random button, next page opens displaying a random number between 0 and the value of the Count from the previous page.
